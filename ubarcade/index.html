<title>Shutdown Notice</title>
<body style="text-align:center">
<h1>It's over</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, after over a year, I am shutting down the website. I don't want to, but I have to. The school is going to monitor my search history, and I can't deal with the stress of that. It was already hard to keep an unblocked game site up, and this just makes it worse. I'm almost in high school, and I can't have upkeep of this website distracting me. Thank you guys for using my website, and I am very sorry.</p>
<p>Also, please don't talk to me about this. I know the moment I publish these changes I will be attacked by thousands of angry immature middle schoolers.</p>
